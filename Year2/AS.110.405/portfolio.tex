    \subsection{Background information}
Does your reader know enough to understand the problem at hand? If not, use this section as a place to (BRIEFLY) mention any relevant background concepts or theorems. Remember to explain them at the level of the audience given! 

\subsection{Task}
Use this section to describe what you're expected to do for the portfolio assignment in question. Remember, this is meant to be self-contained, which means that anyone with the appropriate mathematical background should be able to pick up this portfolio and know what's going on. By the end of this section, your reader should have a sense of the problem or idea that you're planning to address.

\subsection{Strategy}
Use this section to briefly outline how you're planning to address the task that you've explained above. If you're proving a specific theorem, this may be a great place to give a brief outline before going into the nitty-gritty details. 

\columnbreak
\subsection{Solution}
This is where you get into everything and completely address all the nuances needed to address the task you outlined. Even though you'll be talking about details here, make sure that the assignment still follows the outline you've set up. I've formatted this so that the detail of the solution is on the right with the other sections quickly and easily available on the left. This allows your reader to reference between sections easily. 

Don't forget that it is encouraged for you to refer back to past results in the portfolio! If you already proved it once, it's perfectly acceptable to say something along the lines of "As we proved in (Assignment/reference here), result here". This will help with brevity and general readibility!

Please give a good overview and detailed explanation of just what a limit inferior is of a sequence. They will know sequences and have ideas about a limit's existence. But the fact that subsequences can have limits and that the limit inferior will exist for a bounded sequence and what its impact is, will need some description.

Please give a good overview and detailed explanation of just what is a Cauchy Series. Remind your audience of what a series is, and give a good notion of where the name for this particular type of series come from.
\begin{multicols*}{2} 
\subsection{Background information}
We are asked to explain the concept of a Cauchy series, by way of a series.
\subsection{Task}
\subsection{Strategy}
\columnbreak
\subsection{Solution}
	We have previously explored the idea of a sequence in signal processing theoretic: a sequence $\{x_n\}={x_1,x_2,\dots,}$ is a set of measurements of a real quantity $x$ taken at discrete (natural number) instances.\\
	We have also explained what it means for such a sequence to be Cauchy: the difference between measurements $i$ and $j$, $|x_i-x_j|$, gets arbitrarily close to 0 if $i$ and $j$ are sufficiently far down in the sequence.\\
	Convince yourself that a series is a special kind of sequence; in particular, one that can be expressed as the partial sum of measurements of a variable: $\{y_1, y_2,\dots\}=\{x_1, x_1+x_2,\dots,\sum^{k}x_k,\dots\}$. Here, instead of considering the value of individual measurements, we are looking at the sum of all past measurements. This might a priori not look very useful, but it becomes key in computing integrals later on in our journey.\\
	With this view, it should be clear that the Cauchy definition applied to series is the exact interpolation of what we had for "regular" sequences:
	We want the difference between any two measurements $i$ and $j$, $|y_i-y_j|$, to get arbitrarily close by choosing $i,j$ large enough.\\
	However, if we look at our definition of the series' elements with respect to the variable from whence they came, we can actually rewrite this term as \[
		|y_i-y_j|=|\sum_{n=1}^{i}x_n-\sum_{n=1}^{j}x_n|=|\sum_{n=j}^{i}x_n|
	.\] 
	This tells us exactly how to define the Cauchy criterion for series. Notice that it also gives us a preemptive insight into how we might use the original variable $x$ to say something about its series, which wil come in handy for further analysis.

\section{PSet 7 Exercise 7}
Audience: Your classmates.\\
This kind of contains all of the continuity information that we have developed in the course, whether the point is a cluster point or not.
\begin{multicols*}{2} 
\subsection{Background information}
Problem Statement: Let $f:S\to\mathbb{R}$ be a function and $c$, such that for every sequence $\{x_n\}\subset S$, with $\lim x_n=c$, the sequence $\{f(x_n)\}$ converges. We want to show that $f$ is continuous at $c$.
Stated in this form, our attempts at solving the problem seem hopeless: how could we possibly check the truth of this statement for every single sequence converging to $c$?\\
It is the converse direction that gives the theorem its power: if we can verify that a function is continuous at $c$, then we can say something about the image of all sequences limiting to $c$ under $f$. It turns out that this intuition also gives us a guide to actually prove the statement: we will use the contrapositive.
\subsection{Task}
\subsection{Strategy}
As stated before, we will prove this difficult statement by its comparatively simple contrapositive: If $f$ is not continuous at $c$, there exists a sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that $\lim x_n=c$, yet the sequence $\{f(x_n)\}$ does not converge.

\part{Analysis}
\section{PSet 4 Exercise 5}
Audience: Researchers from the Applied Physics Lab: STEM-educated, but might not know the math details or jargon.
There is nothing really fancy about this result. It is a basic fact about analysis. But it highlights the limit laws for sequences, and forces the writer to address a question that is not foreordained as a result. This one could go either way. Maybe that should also be a part of your
discussion of the problem?
\begin{multicols*}{2}
\subsection{Background information}
Problem Statement: Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence. Suppose there are two convergent subsequences $\{x_{ni}\}$ and $\{x_{mi}\}$, where \[
\lim_{i\to\infty}x_{ni}=a \text{ and } \lim_{i\to\infty}x_{mi}=b
.\] 
with $a\neq b$. Prove that  $\{x_n\}$ is not convergent.\\
This proposition is important because it confirms that our idea of convergence is well defined. In effect, if $\lim\{x_n\}$ exists, we can treat it as a legitimate mathematical object that we can then use for further analysis.\\
Consider what would happen if this was not true: we can think of $\{x_{ni}\}$ as a set of measurements on the variable $x$, and  $\{x_{mi}\}$ a different set of measurements, possibly taken at different points in $x$ 's evolution. Convergence means that the long-term behavior of the variable is well defined, so naturally we should expect different sets of measurements to have the same long-term behavior as long as they are repeated to infinity. Proving this will be the crux of the proof.

\part{Examples}
\section{PSet 4 Exercise 4}
Audience: researchers from the Applied Physics Lab: STEM-educated, but might not know the math details or jargon.\\
Aside from just proving the result and giving a good ida of why the result makes sense, you have the opportunity to use the example you constructed in your Week 5 5-minute in-lecture drill. So prove the result for your audience and showcase it with your example.
\begin{multicols*}{2}
\subsection{Background information}
Problem statement: Let $\{x_n\}$ be a convergent monotone sequence. Suppose there exists a $k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that \[
\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=x_k
.\] We want to show that $x_n=x_k$ for all $n\geq k$.\\
We will repeat the "measurement on a variable" interpretation we presented in Problem 5 of this problem set to make intuitive sense of this proposition. The fact that the sequence limits to some $c=x_k$ means that we get arbitrarily close to $c$ as the timestamp of the measurement tends to infinity.\\
However, the further information that the measurements are strictly monotone (nondecreasing or nonincreasing) constrains the \emph{manner} in which we get "arbitrarily close":\\
Without the monotone assumption, it is fully possible that the measurements circle around $c$ while getting arbitrarily close. If the sequence is monotone, the sequence must have a one-sided angle of attack towards its limit: it can never backtrack.\\
This theorem is essentially using the fact that a monotone series can never backtrack to say that if at any point, a measurement in the sequence is equal to the limit, then it is impossible for any further element to be less than the limit or greater than it: One of those will come from the definition of monotonicity, the other from the definition of arbitrarily closeness.

	\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n

\section{PSet 7 Exercise 1.2}
Audience: Your classmates.
Please give a good, detailed explanation of just what the popcorn function is about. Maybe discuss why it is continuous at palces and not at other places. What might this say about the notion of continuity.
\begin{multicols*}{2} 
\subsection{Background information}
Problem Statement: We are asked to explain the Thomae function, or popcorn function.\\
The popcorn function is a tool to strengthen and stretch the intuition muscles we need to use in searching for things to prove as mathematicians. Presenting it as anything else then as a carefully designed contrarian to our intuition is good only to scare off prospective students in mathematics. So, we avoid doing so.
\subsection{Task}
\subsection{Strategy}
\columnbreak
\subsection{Solution}
The Thomae function is defined as: \[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
	\frac{1}{q} & $x$ a rational $\frac{p}{q}$ in lowest form \\
	0 & $x$ irrational or $x=0$
	\end{cases}
.\] 
We follow with one example of something we \emph{might} want to say about all functions in analysis (because it applies to most functions that we're familiar with and that we've used so far), where theThomae function swoops in saying "well, actually!". This is a frustrating but necessary aspect of what it takes to make sure that mathematics stays completely airtight.\\
We \emph{might} want to say that continuity implies differentiability for all functions (we might even want to relax this and say this is the case for at least all \emph{bounded} functions. The Thomae function is bounded by 1, so this will still work as a counterexample).
However, the Thomae function satisfies our definition of continuity at $x=0$. Given any $\epsilon>0$, restrict $x$ such that $|x|<epsilon$. For any such $x$, the object $|f(x)-f(0)|=|f(x)-0|$ is either equal to $|0-0|=0$ if $x$ is irrational or 0, and equal to $|\frac{1}{q}-0|=|\frac{1}{q}|$ if $x$ is a rational in the least form $\frac{p}{q}$.\\
In the first case, we trivially have $|f(x)-f(0)|<\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$. In the second case, we use our valid restriction $|x|=\frac{|p|}{|q|}<\epsilon$ to write $|\frac{1}{q}|<|\frac{p}{q}|<\epsilon$. Either way, continuity is obtained. We fail to find such a result to prove differentiability.

Bijections between sets that have different properties (here one is closed and the other is open) can be quite tricky. Again, what might this say about the notion of continuity?
