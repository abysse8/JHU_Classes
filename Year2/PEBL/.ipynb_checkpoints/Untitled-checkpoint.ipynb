    "First, the masses of 6 microcentrifuge tubes were recorded. Then with a P-1000, 1000 uL of water was pipetted into each sample tube and the masses were recorded again.  The _______ was converted into a ________ using the specific density ( _____ g/mL). Using the same tubes and a P-200, 200 uL of water was pipetted into each tube and the masses were recorded again. The same conversions were done with these new measurements. "

    "I definitely achieved my goals for this lab. I was concerned that my pipette was making a clicking sound, but it did not seem to affect my results. My pipetting skills with both the P-1000 and P-200 were extremely accurate and precise because the standard deviation and percent error were very low (0.000 uL and 0.0 %). This makes sense because even though there was a lot of pipetting, my pipetting skills I have perfected over the last 50 years did not add any appreciable error to my experiment and also because I am making this up completely as an example."
